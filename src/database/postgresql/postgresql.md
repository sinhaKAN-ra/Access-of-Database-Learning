We've been using PostgreSQL for our core banking system for 5 years. The reliability and ACID compliance are exactly what we need for financial transactions. Performance has been excellent even with millions of records.

PostGIS extension makes PostgreSQL perfect for our mapping applications. The spatial queries are powerful and the performance is good. Only downside is the learning curve for spatial functions.

PostgreSQL has been rock solid for our e-commerce platform. We handle thousands of orders per day and never had any data consistency issues. The JSON support is also great for storing product metadata.

New to PostgreSQL but impressed with the query performance. The documentation is excellent and helped me get up to speed quickly. Still learning about optimization but very happy so far.
