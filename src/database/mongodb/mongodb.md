The document model is intuitive and maps well to our application objects. We've had great success with MongoDB for our CMS. The learning curve was minimal coming from a SQL background.

New to MongoDB but impressed with the write performance for our IoT sensors. The time-series collections feature is exactly what we needed. Still learning the aggregation pipeline but it's powerful.
